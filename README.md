# Face-Mask-Detection
A deep learning based on MobileNet architecture to detect whether a person is wearing correctly a mask or not.

### Motivation:
In order to protect ourselves from the COVID-19 Pandemic, almost every one of us tend to wear a face mask. It becomes increasingly necessary to check if the people in the crowd wear face masks in most public gatherings such as Malls, Theatres, Parks. The development of an AI solution to detect if the person is wearing a face mask and allow their entry would be of great help to the society. In this, a simple Face Mask detection system is built using the Deep Learning technique called as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This CNN Model is built using the TensorFlow framework and MobileNetV2.
